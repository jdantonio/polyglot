# Polyglot Programming Exercises

Back in January of 2012 I audited an Algorithms class online through
[Regis Univeristy](http://www.regis.edu/). The first assignment for the class
was to write a program that read through a text file and counted words. The
algorithms for the assignment weren't optimized--it was a learning exercise.
Still, the program was fun and did something non-trivial. Since then I've
implemented the program in a couple of other languages. The goal was never
necessarily to write an optimized or idiomatic version of the program. The goal
was always to experiment with a different language using a known problem. I've
only done this a couple of times but it's become my own personal kata. I'm
putting it one the web in case others find it useful.
