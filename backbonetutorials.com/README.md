## Usage

To test our application we will use a Node.js module called [http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server) to bring up a local webserver and host our page.  To install this locally use this command:

```shell
  npm install -g http-server
```

or if you are on a Mac and get an `EACCES` error.

```shell
  sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Now in the `workspace` folder where you changed the code, run the command:

```shell
http-server
```

Now bring up a browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`.  You should see the application appear in the browser window.  Going forward this mechanism can be used in each of the project step folders to bring up the application.
